## 🖥  Quick Exhibition

A quick introduction and demo to this case study's logic and effect. Several Pictures and logic is included below.

##  📃 Model System Assumptions

· The validation of customer attribute input could be done both in front-end or back-end. I decide to do it in backend (verifing the request) that matches the goal of RESTful design. A full (req, res) process is configure.

· When doing this in the front end, JS regex or JQuery could handle this. This save the resource and time for this action.

##  🤖 Backend Logic

Express is a powerful and scalable backend that provides a fast and comprehensive set tools to build this system. It allows me to manage the data, authenticate users, and perform complex operations with ease.

##  :floppy_disk: Databases (Optional)

For this case study, I also think linking a database for data storage would ;

· AWS MySQL RDS
· MongoDB Atlas
